Welcome to my Simplified React State Management resources page. 
If you came here from my presentation at Orlando Code Camp or a local Bay Area Meetup, here are the assets and resources associated with my talk (and a maybe a few more, just for shitzengiggles). 
If you came across this page another way, I'm glad you found it! 
If you have any questions, you can always tweet me at [@httpjunkie](https://twitter.com/httpJunkie).

## React Hooks Resources?

Getting started with Hooks can be tough, especially if you have only worked with React classes before and have not had much experience with functional components or maybe you just finished understanding everything about the Ract lifecycles used with classes. Buildng a proper application using only functional components is tough enough and a lot to wrap your head around. Even more complex would be learning Hooks side by side with classes or learning how to properly convert a React app with classes over to hooks. For this reason I wanted to supply a list of links geared not only at covering some of the resources found im my talk, but also some links that would help you wrap your head around the different concepts and patterns associated with Hooks.
