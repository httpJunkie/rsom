# Master Detail with React, Crystallize, Apollo and GraphQL 

With Crystallize, you can create structured content with products of any shape and easily query and render them in your app or framework of choice. This post shows how to take a catalogue of Illustrations that we have set up in our Crystallize Tenant and build a decoupled front-end using React to display each product in a master detail format. We will rely on using the **Apollo Client** and **GraphQL** to retrieve our data and provide a wrapper using a higher order component.

Here is a preview of the component we will be developing around our GraphQL data:
![final stage of app](images/illustration-master-detail-final.gif)

It's actually a fully functioning React app with routing, so let's get started an build it!

## Testing Your Crystallize GraphQL Query

Creating a place to organize your ecommerce products is simple with [Crystallize](https://crystallize.com), just create an account in one step with a Google or Facebook user and build a Tenant. For demo purposes today, I will use a Tenant that we have already setup named `demo`.

As the owner of a tenant on Crystallize, I can test my queries out in our [Crystallize GraphQL interface](https://api.crystallize.com/graphql) to visualize my data:

Notice the GraphQL query is a hierarchy of nested data that in a normal REST endpoint might take several round trips to retrieve. We just walk the Graph and we can cherry pick what we want! Try the following query in the Crystallize GraphiQL IDE:

```
{
	catalogue(url:"/illustrations", tenantID:"demo"){
		name
		id
		link
		content_fields
		children{
			link
			name
			product{
				id
				product_image
				price
				price_from
				link
				name
			}
		}
	}
}
```

When you execute the query in GraphiQL, the result is a `data` object at the root. Inside of `data` we have a `catalogue` object with a `name` and `link`, also there is an array named `children` with the `Illustrations` we would like to work with in our master detail page.

## Building Our React Application

We'll use Create React App to get us up and running fast. Use `npx` to create our React app.

```bash
npx create-react-app illustration-demo
```

Let's open this project in a code editor like Visual Studio Code!

```bash
cd illustration-demo && code .
```

Create React App uses Yarn so we will too!

```bash
yarn start
```

![Initial Create React App](images/cra-app-initial.png)

## Adding Dependencies

We need a client to query GraphQL inside of our application, the [Apollo GraphQL Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react) will be our choice for this demo, let's add it to our project. make sure that you are in the root directory and run:

```bash
yarn add apollo-boost @apollo/react-hooks graphql
```

For the purposes of the demo, we will also install `react-router-dom` to help us with basic linking and routing. We will also use `simple-flexbox` for layout:

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom simple-flexbox
```

With these installed we are ready to prepare our app, let's take a look at a wireframe mockup I made to help concept and visualize what we will build.

![Master Detail Wireframe](images/crystallize-master-detail-wireframe.jpg)

We want to match both root: `'/'` and the `'/illustrations' ` path to a component named `IllustrationMasterDetail`. We will have a product links menu on the left side of the page. To the right side will be a placeholder SVG, below it, text that reads: **Select Illustration**. When a product link is clicked on we will see the image, name and price for that product appear on the right.

Our `IllustrationMasterDetail` component will load two child components. To the left will be a component named: `IllustrationList` and to the right, a component named `IllustrationDetails`.

We need to add the files we just talked about and some supporting files. 

Create a directory named `components` inside the `src` directory, we will add all of the following files there:

- illustration.js
- withApolloProvider.js
- IllustrationMasterDetail.jsx
- IllustrationDetails.jsx
- IllustrationList.jsx
- Error404.jsx
- NoImage.jsx
- 404.png

We are keeping all files in the `components` directory for the sake of simplicity. I have also removed the `logo.svg` and `App.scss` from the Create React App demo as they are not needed.

If you want to skip the adding of files, you can clone the repo below:

[httpJunkie / illustration-demo-start](https://github.com/httpJunkie/illustration-demo-start)  

It will still be worth while going over the next section to see what's included in each of the pages at this point.

## Adding The Code

We will start by updating the code in the `index.html`, `src/index.css` and `src/App.js` files, as we add code to each of the files, I will explain what each is doing. 

### public/index.html

```jsx
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Serif|Oxygen:300" rel="stylesheet">
```

Just add the line above to the pages `<head>` above all other link tags.

### src/index.css

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  Font-Family: 'Noto Serif', Serif;
  Font-Size: 16px;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}

H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 {
  Font-Family: 'Oxygen', Sans-Serif;
  margin-top: 0;
  color: #E77494;
}

a.menu {
  color: inherit;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin-bottom: 0.25em;
}
a.menu {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to left, #fff, #E77494 88%);
  background-position: 0% 100%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 00% 2px;
  background-position-y: 1.1em;
  transition: background-size cubic-bezier(0, 0.5, 0, 1) 1s;
}
a.menu:hover,
a.menu:visited:hover,
a.menu:active:hover {
  text-decoration: none;
  background-size: 100% 2px;
}
a.menu:focus,
a.menu:active {
  text-decoration: none;
  background-size: 100% 2px;
}

ul.illustration-list {
  padding: 0; margin: 0;
}
ul.illustration-list > li {
  list-style: none;
  line-height: 2.5em;
  font-size: 1em;
}

.pad-one {
  padding: 1em;
}

.illCrop {
  width: 440px;
  height: 440px;
  object-fit: none;
  object-position: center; 
  border: 1px #222 solid
}

.illPrice,
.illMessage {
  font-family:  'Oxygen', Sans-Serif;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

### src/App.js

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

import IllustrationMasterDetail from './components/IllustrationMasterDetail';
import Error404 from './components/Error404';

const App = () => {
 return (
  <div className="app-container pad-one">
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Switch>
       <Route exact path={["/illustrations/", "/"]} 
        render={(props) => 
          <IllustrationMasterDetail {...props} baseUrl={`/illustrations`} />
        }
       />
       <Route component={Error404} />
      </Switch>
     </BrowserRouter>
   </div>
 );
}

export default App;
```

In `App.js`, we import React Router's `BrowserRouter` and `Route` components for providing route data and declarative route definitions. We also use the `Switch` component in case a user navigates to a route other than the root `'/'` or `'Illustrations'`. In this case they will see our `Error404` component/page as it is the last route defined inside the `Switch`. 

You may have noticed our Route is using a `render` prop instead of a `component` prop. This is because we want to be able to pass some props to the `IllustrationMasterDetail` component. When we use this method we need to be sure to spread the props we get from the route and pass them along too. 

### src/components/IllustrationMasterDetail.jsx

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Column, Row } from "simple-flexbox";

const IllustrationMasterDetail = ({ baseUrl, match }) => {
  const fullLink = `${baseUrl}/${match.params.illustration_link}`;

  return (
    <>
      <Link className='menu' to={`/illustrations`}>
        <h1>Snowball Digital Illustrations</h1>
      </Link>
      <Row horizontal="spaced">
        <Column flexGrow={1} style={{ minWidth: '165px', width: '35%' }}>
          <span>Left Side</span>
        </Column>
        <Column flexGrow={1} style={{ width: '75%' }}>
          <span>Right Side</span>
        </Column>
      </Row>
    </>
  )
};

export default IllustrationMasterDetail;
```

This page is the wrapper so to speak for our Illustration UI (`IllustrationList` and `IllustrationDetail` components). It will load each side by side, the left being a menu with a list of products and the right being a component that shows a placeholder SVG until a product is selected.

You will also notice that we are using `react-router-dom` for it's `Link` component and `simple-flexbox` to help with layout using their `Row` and `Column` components. You can learn more about both here: [ [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start), [Simple Flexbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-flexbox) ]

One more thing to note is that we have `{ destructured }` our props and pulled out two of them by name. The `baseURL` was passed in manually and `match` is something we get from our route props that we spread. We will need `match` to see the product route. An example is: `/Illustrations/Birdman`. This is one of our illustrations and when that URL is loaded we need to show the correct details on the right side of the page.

### src/components/Error404.jsx

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import http404 from './404.png';

function NoMatch ({ location }) {
  return (
    <div style={{padding: '1em', textAlign: 'center'}}>
      path: <code>{location.pathname}</code> not found, 
      <Link className='menu' to={`/`}> wanna get away?</Link>
      <br />
      <img width="300px" src={http404} alt="" />
    </div>
  )
};

export default NoMatch;
```

The component above displays only if no other routes are matched. We display the `location.pathname` that they ended up at, and a link to get back home.

### src/components/NoImage.jsx

```jsx
import React from "react";

const NoImage = ({ stroke = "#555", fill = "#f9f9f9" }) => {
  return (
    <svg width="440px" height="440px" viewBox="0 0 441 441" 
      version="1.1" id="svg-no-image">
      <defs id="defs2" />
      <g id="layer1" transform="translate(0,143)">
        <path id="one" fill={fill} stroke={stroke} 
          d="M 440.78091,297.74834 220.39045,77.357885 0,297.74834 Z" />
        <path id="two" fill={fill} stroke={stroke} 
          d="M -1e-5,297.74835 220.39045,77.357885 -1e-5,-143.03257 Z" />
        <path id="three" fill={fill} stroke={stroke} 
          d="M -3.6e-5,-143.03259 220.39045,77.357885 440.7809,-143.03259 Z" />
        <path id="four" fill={fill} stroke={stroke} 
          d="M 440.78092,-143.0326 220.39045,77.357885 440.78092,297.74833 Z" />
      </g>
    </svg>
  )
}

export default NoImage
```

This component will be loaded until the user has selected an `Illustration`. It takes a `fill` and `stroke` prop for customization and returns an SVG. A fun feature would be to make the width, height and viewBox custamizable.

Let's not get sidetracked, let's test our app with this in place!

```bash
yarn start
```

![illustrator-master-detail preview](images/illustration-master-detail-one.gif)

## Adding Our Crystallize Data for Illustrations

With Apollo, we simply write a GraphQL query, and Apollo Client will take care of requesting and caching the data, we need an Apollo GraphQL Client and a declarative and context style Apollo Provider component.

We will create a higher order component which is just a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a component and in our case with additional non-visual logic. 

Let's get the HOC created and add the following code:

### src/components/withApolloProvider.js

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-boost';
import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/react-hooks';

const withApolloProvider = (WrappedComponent, graphqlEndpoint) => {
  const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: graphqlEndpoint,
  });

  return (props) => (
    <ApolloProvider client={apolloClient}>
      <WrappedComponent {...props} />
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
};

export default withApolloProvider;
```

Our `IllustrationMasterDetail` component is being represented in this file by the `WrappedComponent`. We take a component as an argument and we return the same component wrapped in a Data Provider that exposes the Apollo Client.

So now we can do some work in our `IllustrationMasterDetail` component:

### src/components/IllustrationMasterDetail.jsx

```jsx
import withApolloProvider from './withApolloProvider';

...

const WrappedComponent = 
    withApolloProvider(IllustrationMasterDetail,'https://api.crystallize.com/graphql');
export default WrappedComponent;
```

We have added an import for our HOC and replaced the original `default export` of our `IllustrationMasterDetail` component and instead returning the result of the HOC which is our component wrapped. Now if we had another component that showed posters, like: `PosterMasterDetail`, we could reuse the wrapping logic of this HOC and not duplicate code.

If we step into React Dev Tools we can see that our `ApolloProvider` is now wrapped around our `IllustrationMasterDetail` component.

![ApolloProvider wrapping our component](images/apolloprovider.gif)

Our next step is to use `gql` from `apollo-boost` and query our GraphQL, then we will be able to render our `IllustrationList` on the left side and pass some data to it. 

Ad the code below to `IllustrationList` component so that we can display the product menu that will show up on the left side of the page.

### src/components/illustrationList.jsx

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

function IllustrationList({illustrations}) {
  const listItems = 
    illustrations.map(({ name, link, id }) => (
      <li key={`${name}-${id}`}>
        <Link className='menu' to={`${link}`}>{name}</Link>
      </li>
    )
  );
  return (
    <ul className={`illustration-list`}>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default IllustrationList;
```

All we do here is grab our `illustrations` from the prop of the same name. Use that data to render out a list of `Link` components from **React Router** that when clicked, will append `/product-name` to the URL (link is a derived hyphenated product name).

With that file in place we need to fetch the data that will supply it. Add the following code to `illustration.js`

### src/components/illustration.jsx

```js
import { gql } from 'apollo-boost';
export const illustrationGql = gql`
  {
    catalogue(url:"/illustrations", tenantID:"demo"){
      name
      id
      link
      content_fields
      children{
        link
        name
        product{
          id
          product_image
          price
          price_from
          link
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

We will import this `illustrationGql` and `withApolloProvider` into **IllustrationMasterDetail** along with some other things to help us retrieve the GraphQL data:

### src/components/IllustrationMasterDetail.jsx

```jsx
import { Column, Row } from "simple-flexbox";
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/react-hooks';

import { illustrationGql } from './illustration';
import withApolloProvider from './withApolloProvider';
import IllustrationList from './IllustrationList';

...

  const fullLink = `${baseUrl}/${match.params.illustration_link}`;
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(illustrationGql);
  
  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  const illustrations = data.catalogue.children;

  return (
...

  <Row horizontal="spaced">
    <Column flexGrow={1} style={{minWidth:'165px',width:'35%'}}>
      <IllustrationList illustrations={illustrations} />
    </Column>
    <Column flexGrow={1} style={{ width: '75%' }}>
      <span>Right Side</span>
    </Column>
  </Row>
```

I have added three sections of code we need to update, I kept a few lines that don't need to be changed to aid in knowing where to place the code.

With that all in place, let's update our Route in `App.js` :

### src/App.js

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route exact path={["/illustrations/:illustration_link", "/illustrations/", "/"]}
    render={(props) => <IllustrationMasterDetail {...props} 
      baseUrl={`/illustrations`} />}
  />
  <Route component={Error404} />
</Switch>
```

We have updated the `Illustrations` Route with a slug to match for the the product link. Let's run the project!

```bash
yarn start
```

The left menu (`IllustrationList` component) should be working, if we click on any product, we should see the URL in the browser address bar update!

![left side menu](images/left-side-menu.gif)

Next we can add the code to the `IllustrationDetails` component:

### src/components/IllustrationDetails.jsx

```jsx
import React from "react";
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import NoImage from './NoImage';

function IllustrationDetails({illustration}) {
  return (illustration
    ? (<>
        <div>
          <img className={`illCrop`} src={illustration.product.product_image} 
              alt={`alt`}>
          </img>
        </div>
        <div className="illPrice">
          {illustration.product.name} (${illustration.product.price})
        </div>
      </>)
    : (<>
        <div><NoImage fill={`#FEF1F4`} stroke={`#4C4F5A`}/></div>
        <div className="illMessage">Select an Illustration</div>
      </>)
  );
};

export default IllustrationDetails;

IllustrationDetails.propTypes = {
  illustrationData: PropTypes.object
};
```

What we do here is render a ternary that asks, "Is our `illustration` data falsey?" if not, render the details (`product.product_image`, `product.name`, and `product.price`) otherwise, render this other block of code that contains our SVG placeholder graphic and text.

We check that the data being passed into the component is of `PropTypes.object`.

Let's add the final piece of code that will help to load our `IllustrationDetails` component and pass some data that we filtered using the JavaScript `find()` method to retrieve the slected product:

### src/components/IllustrationMasterDetail.jsx

```jsx
import IllustrationDetails from './IllustrationDetails';

...

  const illustrations = data.catalogue.children;
  const illustration = match.params.illustration_link
    ? illustrations.find(i => i.link === fullLink)
    : null;

  return (
...

  <Row horizontal="spaced">
    <Column flexGrow={1} style={{minWidth:'165px',width:'35%'}}>
      <IllustrationList illustrations={illustrations} />
    </Column>
    <Column flexGrow={1} style={{ width: '75%' }}>
      <IllustrationDetails illustration={illustration} />
    </Column>
  </Row>
```

I have added three sections of code we need to update. We first import `IllustrationDetails`, then we filter the existing illustations data to find the one product that matches the product we want to display the details of. Next we pass that data into the `IllustrationDetails` component. Once it receives data it goes from displaying a placeholder to the actual details for the product.
