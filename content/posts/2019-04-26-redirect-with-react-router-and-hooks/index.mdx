A lot of these short blog posts are just for me to find later when I forget how to do something, but I thought this little trick that you can do with React router was worth sharing.

To set the stage, I have an application with routing and pages already set up.

One of the routes loads a Todo component in which I employ the `useReducer` hook in order to keep track of the todos state (local state). I have contrived a very simple feature that will redirect the user to the Home route once the Todos are cleared. Without thinking of all of the edge cases for this feature, I just want to get a basic redirect working using some basic logic, a quick and dirty example and we can iron the details out later if we want to.

If we look at the `Todos.js` file, we will see that we have a function that calls `dispatch()` and sends `CLEAR_TODOS` as an action type to our reducer.

In my contrived example, I know that I want to at the very least redirect to Home once the user clicks on "CLEAR TODOS", in a better example I would notify the user (which I am not doing in this code) and then redirect to Home because our todo list is cleared. So what I want to do here is tap into a Hook that I will create which has a state variable named `toHome` and a related set/update method called `setToHome()`. The code below is a standard `useState` hook:

In order to make the page redirect when the `toHome` state variable is set to `true`, we just need to render a regular Redirect component from React Router and we will use a ternary statement to inline that component if true and if not, we will use `null` or render nothing:
