A lot of these short blog posts are just for me to find later when I forget how to do something, but I thought this little trick that you can do with React router was worth sharing.

To set the stage, I have an application with routing and pages already set up.

```jsx
<main>
  <Switch>
    <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
    <Route exact path="/todos" component={Todos} />
    <Route exact render={() => <h2 className="four-ofour">404 Page Not Found</h2>} />
  </Switch>
</main>
```

One of the routes loads a Todo component in which I employ the `useReducer` hook in order to keep track of the todos state (local state). I have contrived a very simple feature that will redirect the user to the Home route once the Todos are cleared. Without thinking of all of the edge cases for this feature, I just want to get a basic redirect working using some basic logic, a quick and dirty example and we can iron the details out later if we want to.

If we look at the `Todos.js` file, we will see that we have a function that calls `dispatch()` and sends `CLEAR_TODOS` as an action type to our reducer.

```js
/* After clearing Todos, 
    wait two seconds and then set toHome to true
    (in JSX we can render a <Redirect> component based on toHome's value) */
function clearTodos() {
  dispatch({ type: 'CLEAR_TODOS' })
  setTimeout(() => setToHome(true), 2000)
}
```
 
In my contrived example, I know that I want to at the very least redirect to Home once the user clicks on "CLEAR TODOS", in a better example I would notify the user (which I am not doing in this code) and then redirect to Home because our todo list is cleared. So what I want to do here is tap into a Hook that I will create which has a state variable named `toHome` and a related set/update method called `setToHome()`. The code below is a standard `useState` hook:

```js
/*  create a piece of state (toHome)
    with a method to update that state (setToHome)
    and give it a default value of false */
const [toHome, setToHome] = useState(false)
```

In order to make the page redirect when the `toHome` state variable is set to `true`, we just need to render a regular Redirect component from React Router and we will use a ternary statement to inline that component if true and if not, we will use `null` or render nothing:

```jsx
return (
  <>
   /* if (toHome) is true
        ? then we render a React Router <Redirect> component
        : otherwise we do null/nothing gets rendered */
    {toHome ? <Redirect to"/" /> : null}
  </>
)
```
