## A Fullstack React Meetup

I am starting a bi-weekly meetup for Fullstack React and would like to invite anyone who wants to learn more about JavaScript, React, CSS/SCSS, APIs, GraphQL, Document Databases and overall just wants to join a community of folks getting together to learn about web development using the React ecosystem and related technologies.

## When and Where Will the Meetup Take Place?

The first meetup will be on January 21st at 11am PST, 7pm GMT, 8pm WAT. Since a majority of those interested are from the WAC timezone I have worked around hours that work for them, but should also help to make sure that those from the US and Europe find the meeting time accommodable.

### Fullstack React Meetup Schedule for 2021

- **January 21st (11am PST, 2pm EST, 7pm GMT, 8pm WAT)**: React From Scratch
  Build a React project from scratch using Webpack, Babel, ESLint and custom components using SCSS.
- **February 4th (11am PST, 2pm EST, 7pm GMT, 8pm WAT)**: Fullstack React and GraphQL
  Create a self-contained repository with an Express Server, GraphQL API and Apollo Client in React.
- **February 18th**: Fullstack React and REST with Session-based Authentication
  Create a self-contained repository with an Express Server, REST API, and Blog frontend application in React.

Developers typically only need to be introduced to a new technology and shown the basics to get them started. The real learning will come as they take that knowledge and apply it to their projects. Therefore we focus a lot on providing a view of the overall landscape of fullstack development in React and applying the basics across all of these technologies more shallow than deep dives (except for React). By the nature of the program, in time those attending will become very proficient in React from a fundamentals standpoint and be able to use the community members as a resource or ask questions.

## How Much Does it Cost?

**Other than your time, it's free and open to anyone**

Join any of our meetups via Zoom. This meeting is open to the public.
