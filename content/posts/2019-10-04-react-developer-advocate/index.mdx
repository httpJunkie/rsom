I have had the most amazing year and a half as a developer advocate and working for KendoReact at Progress Software a truly amazing company and I want to bring all of this experience and apply it to your team as a developer advocate or engineer in 2020!

Below are all of my blog articles, conference talks, videos and workshops from 2018 and 2019 that I have produced on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/httpjunkie), [Telerik.com](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/author/eric-bishard) for Tesla, the Angular team and mostly for my dear friends and family at [KendoReact](https://www.kendoreact.com).

Also, feel free to [download my resume](/Eric-Bishard_Resume.pdf)!

## KendoReact.com

I had written about React Hooks on the [Telerik.com blog](https://telerik.com/blogs) and once I had a gang of articles on the subject, I combined them all knowledge into a single resource with help from my amazing team on design, marketing, SEO and getting it deployed onto the KendoReact.com website where it could better serve the React community and our customers who use React on a daily basis. It was an amazing idea and I owe that to my team for encouraging me and helping me to create this amazing resource on Hooks. It replaced the following articles:
 
- How to Use Basic React Hooks for State and Effects
- How to Use Basic React Hooks for Context
- How to Use Basic React Hooks for Reducers
- Everything You Need to Create a Custom React Hook
- Discovering React Hooks with KendoReact

Again, We rolled them all into one article and redirected each former blog post to the applicable section of the new guide:

[React Hooks Guide by Eric Bishard](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/react-hooks-guide/)

I just finished working on an article up with my [@KendoReact](https://twitter.com/kendoreact) team, ask 25 React developers about their tips on being productive in React.
