I'm trying to write about topics like this one with very little words, just the instructions one needs to get the job done and then they can tweak the process on their own. For articles like this one, I'm going to employ some consistency, each article will have prerequisites, installation, implementation and a recap, that's it!

## Prerequisites

- Running Node, NPM, Git and and IDE
- Inkscape installed
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS
- Good understanding of React
- Dope!

## Creating an SVG with Text in Inkscape

How you get to your design of your svg is not as important of what to do with it between Inkscape and React. I'm just going to import an already created SVG, and sijply save it to file.

We are using Inkscape to simply make modifications to an existing svg or to create our own, the two animation below show me doing both. Just in case you need a visual aid.

But what if you wanted to make an SVG that we could create in Inkscape, including text, shapes or whatever. I'm keeping it very simple, one color SVG.

**File New** > **Create Text** > **Path** > **Object to path** > **File Save As "iheartsf.svg"**

My point here is that Inkscape is that easy. YOur create something vector, you save it as svg. But we need to edit the SVG before bringing it to React and I like doing this by hand.

## Removing The Trash From our SVG

Not to call their meta data trash, but we don't need it and we dont' want it. Open the SVG in Visual Studio code, we are going to remove the shit we don't need from each file:

## Cleaning up `iheartsf.svg`

First off, we want to get rid of everything bu teh `<svg>` tag and it's contents. So remove the `<?xml version="...>` tag.

Let's get rid of all `xmlns:`, `sodipodi:`, and `inkscape:` attributes and their values.

Get rid of the entire tag named: `<sodipodi:namedview>`, remove that entire tag.

Get rid of the entire `<metadata>` tag and all of it's content.

At this point we will only have our `<svg></svg>` tags and their attributes (`version`, `id`, `width`, `height`, `viewBox`) and values.

What I was left with was this code below:

```svg

  </g>

```

As you can see, I removed the `style` attributes and modified the `id` value to represent teh letter that that block of code represents in our SVG.
