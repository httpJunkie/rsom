excerpt: Let's get started with GraphQL by creating server with Node's Express framework that can handle basic queries and mutations.
---

This is the first of a series of projects to get you familiar with using GraphQL, React and Apollo. In this tutorial I assume the following:

- You have node and npm installed
- You are using Visual Studio Code
- You understand HTML, CSS, and JS
- You have read up on the basics of GraphQL

The last item is very important, you should not only know where the basic documentation for GraphQL is, but you should have skimmed through the following three pages:

- [Introduction](https://graphql.org/learn/)
- [Queries and Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)
- [Schemas and Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/)

If you have not skimmed through these pages, you are not prepared to move forward. At the very least I provide these pages in case you are unsure what a particular line of code is doing in this tutorial.

## Project Setup and Dependencies

Create a new directory to house our server and initialize an npm project:

```bash
mkdir gql-server && cd gql-server && npm init
```

Install our dependencies and open our project in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
npm i graphql express express-graphql && code .
```

We should now have Visual Studio Code open and our project is ready for us to start working in!

## Create Our Dummy Data

In a new file named `blogs.js`, add an array of objects that we can use for data in our GraphQL server:

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Preferred Color Scheme in React',
    author: 'Eric Bishard',
    topic: 'React',
    url: 'https://www.reactstateofmind.com/preferred-color-scheme-in-react'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'A Guide to Learning React Hooks',
    author: 'Eric Bishard',
    topic: 'Hooks',
    url: 'https://www.reactstateofmind.com/a-guide-to-learning-react-hooks'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: 'React Accessibility Resources',
    author: 'Eric Bishard',
    topic: 'React',
    url: 'https://www.reactstateofmind.com/react-accessibility-resources'
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: 'React Developer Advocate',
    author: 'Eric Bishard',
    topic: 'Devrel',
    url: 'https://www.reactstateofmind.com/react-developer-advocate'
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: 'Redirect with React Router and Hooks',
    author: 'Eric Bishard',
    topic: 'Hooks',
    url: 'https://www.reactstateofmind.com/redirect-with-react-router-and-hooks'
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    title: 'Writing From a Beginner Developer\'s Perspective',
    author: 'Eric Bishard',
    topic: 'Writing',
    url: 'https://www.reactstateofmind.com/writing-from-a-beginner-developer-s-perspective'
  },
]
```

## Create Our Resolvers 

Our GraphQL server will have a few specific endpoints for reading and updating our data.

Given the need to keep things basic I have decided on three endpoints only: `blog`, `blogs` and `updateBlogTopic`.

In a new file named `resolvers.js`, add the following functions as `module.exports`:

```js
let blogData = require('./blogs')

module.exports = {
  getBlog: (args) => {
    return blogData.find(blog => blog.id === args.id)
  },
  getBlogs: (args) => {
    return args.topic 
      ? blogData.filter(blog => blog.topic === args.topic)
      : blogData
  },
  updateBlogTopic: ({id, topic}) => {
    blogData.map(blog => {
      return blog.id === id 
        ? blog.topic = topic
        : blog
    })
    return blogData.find(blog => blog.id === id)
  }
}
```

In this file we have imported the blog data from our `blogs.js` file.

The first resolver `getBlog` will allow us to find a specific blog by `id`.

The second resolver `getBlogs` allows getting all of the blog data if no argument is passed or we can get blogs by topic if an argument for `topic` is passed.

The third resolver `updateBlogTopic` will set the topic for the blog specified to a new string.

> This is not bulletproof code, it's for demo purposes, but it illustrates how we can serve and manage our data using GraphQL.

## Creating the server

In order to create a GraphQL server with a minimal amount of code, we use a package called `express-graphql` that enables us to define our schema, a root type, and specify if we want the GraphiQL IDE to be enabled.

In a file named `server.js` we will combine the code needed for `express` and `graphql` to work together.

```js
const express = require('express')
const graphqlHTTP = require('express-graphql')
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql')

let { getBlog, getBlogs, updateBlogTopic } = require("./resolvers")

const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    blog(id: Int!): Blog
    blogs(topic: String): [Blog]
  }
  type Mutation {
    updateBlogTopic(id: Int!, topic: String!): Blog
  }
  type Blog {
    id: Int
    title: String
    author: String
    topic: String
    url: String
  }
`)

const root = {
  blog: getBlog,
  blogs: getBlogs,
  updateBlogTopic: updateBlogTopic
}

const serverPort = 4000
const serverUrl = '/graphql'

const app = express()
app.use(serverUrl, graphqlHTTP({
  schema: schema,
  rootValue: root,
  graphiql: true
}))

app.listen(serverPort, () => {
  let message = `GraphQL server now running on http://localhost:${serverPort}${serverUrl}`
  console.log(message)
})
```

In this file we do the following:

- Import our dependencies (`express`, `express-graphql` and `graphql`)
- Import our resolvers (which in turn uses our blogs data)
- Define our GraphQL schema, mutations, and types
- Define our root type (Our GraphQL endpoints)
- Create our Express server hosting our GraphQL API

With this final file in place, we are ready to run our project.

## Run Our Queries in GraphiQL

In the main project directory (targeting our `server.js` file) run:

```bash
node server
```

This will start our Express/GraphQL server and we can click on the link in the terminal: [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql)

Here we will see our GraphiQL IDE, let's test out each of our endpoints and it's capabilities!

For each example, we will paste the first code sample into the query pane and if a second code sample exists, it will go into the varaibles pane:

### Get a Single Blog

```graphql
query getSingleBlog($blogID: Int!) {
  blog(id: $blogID) {
    title
    author
    topic
    url
  }
}
```
```graphql
{"blogID": 1}
```

### Get Blogs by Topic

```graphql
query getBlogsByTopic($blogTopic: String!) {
  blogs(topic: $blogTopic) {
    title
    author
    topic
    url
  }
}
```
```graphql
{"blogTopic": "React"}
```

### Get All Blogs

```graphql
query {
  blogs {
    title
    author
    topic
    url
  }
}
```

### Get Several Blogs by ID Using Fragments

```graphql
query getBlogsWithFragment($blogID1: Int!, $blogID2: Int!) {
  blog1: blog(id: $blogID1) {
    ...blogFields
  }
  blog2: blog(id: $blogID2) {
    ...blogFields
  }
}

fragment blogFields on Blog {
  title
  author
  topic
  url
}
```
```graphql
{
  "blogID1": 1,
  "blogID2": 2
}
```

### Mutate/Update Blog Topic by BlogID

```graphql
mutation updateBlogTopic($id: Int!, $topic: String!) {
  updateBlogTopic(id: $id, topic: $topic) {
    ...blogFields
  }
}

fragment blogFields on Blog {
  title
  author
  topic
  url
}
```
```graphql
{
  "id": 2,
  "topic": "React Hooks"
}
```

### Summary

We have walked through creating a basic GraphQL server with Node's Express framework that can handle basic queries and mutations using in-memory data, a list of blogs and learned how to setup resolvers for each endpoint and how to use the GraphiQL IDE to query and test our endpoints and data.
