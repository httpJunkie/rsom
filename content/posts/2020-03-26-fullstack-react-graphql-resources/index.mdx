## Fullstack React and GraphQL Resources page

Getting started with React and GraphQL can be quite confusing at first if are not acquainted with the technologies even if you have JavaScript and experience building React applications and/or APIs in general. 
For this reason I have created this resource to help you find all of the sites and information that has helped me along the way.

Below I will link to the resources roughly in the order that that they are used throughout the tutorial series below.

### GraphQL Server Resources and Dependencies

GraphQL got it's start during the shift to mobile around 2010 and 2011 happening and at Facebook, their strategy at the time was not working. 
They were traditionally very web focused and their first attempts at mobile were leveraging existing web technology. 
They needed to rewrite the Facebook iOS application and started with the existing REST APIs, soon it was evident that this strategy would not work. 
The story that follows started with building a greenfield Newsfeed API and a new graph API project called SuperGraph, fortunately has been documented by [Honeypot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsUalyRg43M8D60mtHe6YcA): [GraphQL: The Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783ccP__No8)
